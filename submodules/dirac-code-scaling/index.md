Parallel HPC resources, such as computing clusters or supercomputers, are incredibly useful in reducing the time-to-results for computationally intensive tasks. However, these computing resources are often in very high demand, and it’s important that any code makes efficient use of them. When submitting an application to add new software to DiRAC, profiles of its scalability characteristics are required, and this lesson will introduce you to that process and what is expected.
