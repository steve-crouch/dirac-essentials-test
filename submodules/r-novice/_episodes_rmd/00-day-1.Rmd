To start with we will focus on the first three learning objectives and
get your working environment set up.

## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term "`R`" is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is a very popular way to not only write R
scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly,
RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.


## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the
results of your analysis do not rely on a succession of pointing
and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that's a good
thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data,
you don't have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain
your results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the
code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and
spot mistakes.

Working with scripts enables a deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the
same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be
reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.


### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R
provides a framework to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your
data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population
genetics, and a lot more.


### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether
your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won't make much difference to
you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data
types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your
computer or on the web.


### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any
aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.


### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through
mailing lists and websites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/),
or on the [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/).



## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an
open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer,
inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will
generate.

![RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer, Console.](fig/rstudio-screenshot.png)

RStudio is divided into 4 "Panes": the **Source** for your scripts and documents
(top-left, in the default layout), your **Environment/History** (top-right) which shows
all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History),
your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right), and
the R **Console** (bottom-left). The placement of these
panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options ->
Pane Layout).

## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working directory**. All of the
scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files that indicate
where inside the project a file is located. Working this way makes it
a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with
others.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its "Projects"
interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also
remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it). Go through
the steps for creating an "R Project" for this tutorial below.

1. Start RStudio.
2. Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`. Choose `New Directory`, then
  `New Project`.
3. Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory"), and choose a convenient
  location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the
  day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`).
4. Click on `Create Project`.
5. (Optional) Set Preferences to 'Never' save workspace in RStudio.

A workspace is your current working environment in R which includes any user-defined
object. By default, all of these objects will be saved, and automatically loaded,
when you reopen your project. Saving a workspace to `.RData` can be cumbersome,
especially if you are working with larger datasets, and it can lead to hard to
debug errors by having objects in memory you forgot you had.
To turn that off, go to Tools --> 'Global Options' and select the 'Never' option
for 'Save workspace to .RData' on exit.'

![Set 'Save workspace to .RData on exit' to 'Never'](fig/rstudio-preferences.png)

> ### Stretch Challenge (Difficult - 1hr+)
> Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project` and choose `New Directory` like before.
> Then investigate the other project structures that are available such as 'Shiny
> Web Application' or 'R Package'. If you're interested in either of these, have a look at this further information
> about making your own [Shiny Web Application](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
> or [R Package](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/writing-r-package/).
{: .challenge}

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will make it easy to
find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple
projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**,
and **documents**.

 - **`data_raw/` & `data/`** Use these folders to store raw data and intermediate
   datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake
   of transparency and [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance),
   you should *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much
   of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts,
   rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data
   is also a good idea. For example, you could have files
   `data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt` and `...plot2.txt` kept separate from
   a `data/tree.survey.csv` file generated by the
   `scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R` script.
 - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other
   text.
 - **`scripts/`** This would be the location to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your
   functions (more on that later).
 - **Additional (sub)directories** depending on your project needs.


For this workshop, we will need a `data_raw/` folder to store our raw data, and we
will use `data/` for when we learn how to export data as CSV files, and a
`fig/` folder for the figures that we will save.

* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data_raw` within your newly created working directory
  (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/`). (Alternatively, type `dir.create("data_raw")` at
  your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a `data` and a
  `fig` folder.

We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory because we
are only going to use one file and it will make things easier. Create this using the new file button in the top left hand corner and select R Script, the hit save and name it `data-carpentry-script`.

Your working directory should now look like this:
![](fig/r-starting-how-it-should-look-like.png)


> ### Stretch Challenge (Intermediate - 15 mins)
> Try creating the file structure shown below using only commands in the R console.
{: .challenge}

![](fig/file_structure_diagram.png)

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When using R projects the
working directory has a .Rproj file in it. When you write code for
your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root of your working
directory and only need files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the
RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory
should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and select "Set As Working
Directory". Alternatively you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to
reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line
because it will fail on someone else's computer.


## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or
*code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer
and we can understand. We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the
computer to follow the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those
commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using
script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in
RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R
language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where
the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type
commands directly into the console and press `Enter` to execute those commands,
but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type
the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there
is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!)
can replicate the results on their computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using
the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> shortcut (on Macs, <kbd>`Cmd`</kbd> +
<kbd>`Return`</kbd> will work, too). The command on the current line in the
script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently
selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in
this
[RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it
receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using
<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to execute it, and when
ready, will show the results and come back with a new `>` prompt to wait for new
commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn't complete yet,
the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.
When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click
inside the console window and press <kbd>`Esc`</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete
command and return you to the `>` prompt.


## Seeking help

### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions

![RStudio help interface.](fig/rstudiohelp.png)

One of the fastest ways to get help, is to use the RStudio help interface.
This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand panel of RStudio.
As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word "Mean", RStudio tries to also
give a number of suggestions that you might be interested in. The description
is then shown in the display window.

### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `lm()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?lm
```

### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use the
`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.
However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a
match to your search request

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
??kruskal
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use
the [rdocumentation.org](https://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches
through the help files across all packages available.

Finally, a generic Google or internet search "R \<task\>" will often either send
you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful forum where someone
else has already asked your question.

### I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds"). If the message is very generic, you
might also include the name of the function or package you're using in your
query.

### Where to ask for help?

* The other people here; you might also be interested in organizing regular meetings following
  the workshop to keep learning from each other.
* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you,
  they might be able and willing to help you.
* [Stack Overflow's `[r]`-tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=Votes):
  Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
  words in the search to find the answers. If your question
  hasn't been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an
  answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on [how to ask
  a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

Now that we have a working environment set up we can start on the basics of R.

## Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r, purl = FALSE, results='markup'}
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

{: .challenge}


However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to
_objects_.

A _value_ is a piece of information that we want to store and retrieve at some
later time, i.e. a number, a sequence of numbers, or even collections of data, for now
we will start with numbers and later move onto collections of numbers which in R are
called _vectors_.

An _object_ is programming speak for a thing with known properties. Lets consider
an example that we would all be familiar with before jumping into some R.

I tell you that I have a _car_, in this case the car is the _object_.
Without any further information you instinctively know that the _object_ called _car_
has several _attributes_. For example, _colour_, _make_, _model_, _numberplate_. You can
use this predefined model to ask sensible questions. For example if you ask me,
what model the car is (or model(_car_)) I can tell you 'Corsa'. However, if you were to ask me breed(_car_) this would be a
nonsense question to which I would not be able to answer, where as breed(_pet_)
then I could tell you 'sheepdog'.

> ### Challenge
> Write down three other attributes for the object pet?
>
> ```{text_answer, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
> Including but not limited to: Species, Age, Colour, Name, Sex, Owner...
> ```
{: .challenge}

In this tutorial we will use the predefined R objects for vectors and numerical values.
We will see that these are much simpler than the linguistic examples above, and we learn the
sort of _attributes_ we expect them to have and how to inspect an object to tell us its
set of _attributes_.

To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on
the left. So, after executing `weight_kg <- 55`, the value of `weight_kg` is `55`.
The arrow can be read as 55 **goes into** `weight_kg`.

### What is my object?

Once an _object_ is created we can get information about that object in the
Environment tab in the top right of RStudio. For example, 'weight_kg' has the type numeric
length 1 and value 55. Make sure to keep an eye on the other values that appear here
when using RStudio to understand what objects you have. This tab is great for small variables,
when inspecting larger or more complicated objects it is better to use more advanced methods we
will cover later on.


### How do I name my objects?

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They
cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is). R is case sensitive
(e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`). There are some names that
cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g.,
`if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use
other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`). If in
doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also best to
avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and
dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
To avoid confusion, don't include dots in names. It is also recommended to use nouns
for object names, and verbs for function names. It's important to be consistent
in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.).
Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future
self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides are
[Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), [Jean
Fan's](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the
[tidyverse's](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse's is very
comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the
[**`lintr`**](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package to automatically check
for issues in the styling of your code.

> ### Objects vs. variables
>
> What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many other
> programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and `variable` can
> have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words
> are used synonymously. For more information see:
> https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects


When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything.
You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds
(weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
other objects.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
object, `weight_lb`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

### Comments

The comment character in R is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a script
will be ignored by R. It is best practice to leave notes and explanations in your
scripts. So that others can understand your code and that you can remember what each line does.

> age  <- age - 20        # age?
> mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?

{: .challenge}


### Functions and their arguments

Functions automate sets of commands
including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
usually takes one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)
```

Here, the value of `ten` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
the object `weight_kg`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.

The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which
may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value:
these are called *options*. Options are typically used to alter the way the
function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to
use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value
of your choice which will be used instead of the default.

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
round(3.14159)
```

Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)` to find what
arguments it takes, or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
args(round)
```

```{r, results = TRUE, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
?round
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
type `digits = 2` or however many we want.

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

## Vectors and data types

```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
### Vectors and data types
```

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R. A vector is composed by a series
of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values
to a vector using the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal
weights and assign it to a new object `weight_g`:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here to tell R that
these are characters and not objects.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data.
The function `class()` indicates what kind of object you are working with:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its
elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:

```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:
```{r, results = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`,
add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
`weight_g`. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result
back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset.
As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or
calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type.
The 6 **atomic vector** types are:

* `"character"` for text
* `"numeric"` or `"double"` for non-interger numbers
* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,
  `1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting
your vector as the argument.

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other important
ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`),
factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

{: .challenge}

## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the
original one:

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of
other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

Here, `>` for "greater than", `<` stands for "less than", `<=` for "less than
or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal sign `==` is a test for
numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be
confused with the single `=` sign, which performs variable assignment (similar
to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could use the
"or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly
become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of
a search vector are found:

```{r, results = 'show', purl = FALSE}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```

{: .challenge}

## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets it includes the concept of missing data.
Missing data are represented in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data
you are working with include missing values. This feature
makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring
the missing values.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the
functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for
examples.


```{r, purl = FALSE}
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

We have now learnt enough of the basics of R to be able to use R in place of spreadsheets.
As the previous lessons will have shown you spreadsheets can be good for small amounts of data
that can be managed _by hand_. With R will will be able to load large sets of data and create
readable, reliable, and reproducible data analysis scripts.

## Presentation of the Survey Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Presentation of the survey data
```

We are investigating the animal species diversity and weights found within plots at our study
site. The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file.
Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file
that contains the survey data from Figshare.
Lets investigate the `download.file()` function.

In the R console type `?download.file` and then look at the help view that will
open on the bottom right. We can see a description and a list of arguments. We need
the first two, `url` and `destfile`.

> * url: A character string giving a source URL for the data we
>   use "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169".
> * destfile: A character string (or _vector_) denoting the destination and name for
>   the downloaded data we use "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv".

You'll need the folder on your machine called "data_raw" in your working envronment
which we made earlier. So this command downloads a file from Figshare, names it
"portal_data_joined.csv" and adds it to the preexisting folder named "data_raw".

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data we use `read.csv()` to load the content of the
CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`, we can again use `?`
and find the arguments of `?read.csv`. This time we just need the first argument
`file` which we give the location of the file i.e. `destfile` from before.

### Note
> It would be worth your time looking over all the arguments of `read.csv` as reading
> in CSV files will likely be a useful skill during your research.

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can check the environment pane in RStudio.

To check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame we use the
function `head()`:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(surveys)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## Try also
View(surveys)
```

## What are data frames?

Data frames are a data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets or other tabulated data.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](fig/data-frame.svg)


We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```

## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7]
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ]
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is
converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and
usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in this lesson, the best
practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your
date is stored as a separate variable. Using `str()`, We can confirm that our
data frame has a separate column for day, month, and year, and that each contains
integer values.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
str(surveys)
```
We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package **`lubridate`**
(which belongs to the **`tidyverse`**; learn more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).
When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library("tidyverse")`), the core packages get loaded.
**`lubridate`** however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to
load it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`

Start by loading the required package:

```{r load-package, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library("lubridate")
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a
`Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can
be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is a character
vector formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".

Let's create a date object and inspect the structure:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let's paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-"))
str(my_date)
```
We can apply this operation to each row of the surveys dataset.
We extract the vectors `surveys$year`, `surveys$month`, and `surveys$day`.
Using `paste()` we can combine these vectors into a new vector for character dates.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
dates_char_vec <- paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")
```
This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:
```{r, purl=FALSE}
date_vec <- ymd(dates_char_vec)
```

Something went wrong lets use `summary` to inspect `date_vec`:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
summary(date_vec)
```

Some dates have missing values. Let's investigate where they are coming from.

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
missing_dates_vec <- dates_char_vec[is.na(date_vec)]
head(missing_dates_vec)
```
or
```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
missing_dates_tab <- surveys[is.na(date_vec), c("year", "month", "day")]
head(missing_dates_tab)
```

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your
analyses, how would you deal with this situation?

### Note
> If the data is to be discarded we can use the `not` logical operator `!` to make a
> filter for the bad dates.
> ```
> date_vec_cleaned <- date_vec[!is.na(date_vec)]
> ```
> However for now we will include the bad dates and can us this simple filter later if needed.

The resulting `Date` vector `date_vec` can be added to `surveys` as a new column
called `date`:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys$date <- date_vec
str(surveys) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the class
```

### Note
> For completeness sake it is worth noting that the above could be achieved in one line.
> `surveys$date <- ymd(paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-"))`
> However, we would again see the warning and could inspect it like so:
> `summary(surveys$date)`
> `head(surveys[is.na(surveys$date), , c("year", "month", "day")])`
> This way the r environment is kept cleaner however it is more difficult to unpick where
> errors have occured.
