Fist we need to reload the surveys data frame.

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

## Factors

When we did `str(surveys)` we saw that several of the columns consist of
integers.

Please note the default behavior of R has changed recently with the release of
4.0.0 [https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2020/000653.html].

If using R version 3.\*.\*:
The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`, `plot_type`, ... however, are
of a special class called `factor`.

If using R version 4.\*.\*:
The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`, `plot_type`, ... are strings! The
behavior was changed so `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` is the default. So we are all
working with the same data types please reload the data using the following:
```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Factors are very useful and actually
contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are
going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and
they can be ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often behave) like character
vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful
when treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()` and you can find the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `sex` vector would be:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex # current order
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"female"`,
`"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is "male"?  You wouldn't
be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have
this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the species names in our example dataset).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.character(sex)
```

In some cases, you may have to convert factors where the levels appear as
numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector. For
instance, in one part of your analysis the years might need to be encoded as
factors (e.g., comparing average weights across years) but in another part of
your analysis they may need to be stored as numeric values (e.g., doing math
operations on the years). This conversion from factor to numeric is a little
trickier. The `as.numeric()` function returns the index values of the factor,
not its levels, so it will result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case)
set of numbers. One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters,
and then to numbers.

Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

* We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
* We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
* We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the
  vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor
level. Let's look at the number of males and females captured over the course of
the experiment:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment:
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
```

In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for which the
sex information hasn't been recorded. Additionally, for these individuals,
there is no label to indicate that the information is missing or undetermined. Let's rename this
label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we're going to pull out
the data on sex and work with that data, so we're not modifying the working copy
of the data frame:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
head(sex)
levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)
head(sex)
```

> ### Challenge
>
>  * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
>  * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "undetermined", can you recreate the
> barplot such that "undetermined" is last (after "male")?
>
> ```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE, results = 'markup'}
> levels(sex)[2:3] <- c("female", "male")
> sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
> plot(sex)
> ```

> surveys$hindfoot_length <- as.factor(surveys$hindfoot_length)
> plot(surveys$hindfoot_length)
> ```
{: .challenge}


### Using `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

In R versions previous to 4.0, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain
characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors by default. However, since version 4.0
columns that contain characters (i.e. text) are NOT coerced (= converted) into factors.

Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these
columns as `character` or you may want them to be `factor`.

 `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an argument called `stringsAsFactors`
 which can be set to `FALSE` for character or `TRUE` for factor.

In most cases, it is preferable to keep `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when importing
data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data
type.


```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## Compare the difference between our data read as `factor` vs `character`.
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
## Convert the column "plot_type" into a factor
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
```


The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an
annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data
you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame.

# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. **`dplyr`** is a package for
making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables
you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`,
come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. You should
already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an
"umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which
work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.


The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new
   learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware
   of.

We have seen above that when building or importing a data frame,
the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted) into
the `factor` data type. We had to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`** to
avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type.

This time we will use the **`tidyverse`** package to read the data and avoid having
to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

If we haven't already done so, we can type `install.packages("tidyverse")` straight
into the console. In fact, it's better to write this in the console than in our script
for any package, as there's no need to re-install packages every time we run the script.

Then, to load the package type:


```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation
tasks, built to work directly with data frames.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for
plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one
row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its
own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups
(e.g., a time period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number).
Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools
for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

### Note
> An additional feature of **`dplyr`** is the
> ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of
> doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database,
> queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are
> returned. This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted
> in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
> memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you
> can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull
> back into R only what you need for analysis.

{: .challenge}

### Getting started with Tidyverse

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package
**`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.


```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by each column name and its data type.
When you execute `read_csv` on a data file, it looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and
guesses the data type for each column as it reads it into R. For example, in this dataset, `read_csv`
reads `weight` as `col_double` (a numeric data type), and `species` as `col_character`. You have the
option to specify the data type for a column manually by using the `col_types` argument in `read_csv`.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## preview the data
View(surveys)
```

Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a "tibble". Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we
introduced in the previous lesson. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our
purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it
   only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one
   screen.
2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.


## Managing Data with dplyr

We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
## Challenge:
## Before we use the functions...
## Thinking about the survey dataset, or another dataset you are familiar with
## can you think of a use case for each of the functions based on their descriptions above?
## Discuss and share them within your group.
```
{: .challenge}

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id`
and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually.
With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically
with **`dplyr`**.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()`
to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes
the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on
its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`-ed
for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`,
and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

>     select(record_id, month, year, sex, weight)
> ```
{: .challenge}

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`**
functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove
those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!`
symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run off the
screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tail()
```

Here, we used `tail()` to look at the last six rows of our summary. Before, we had
used `head()` to look at the first six rows. We can see that the `sex` column contains
`NA` values because some animals had escaped before their sex and body weights
could be determined. The resulting `mean_weight` column does not contain `NA` but
`NaN` (which refers to "Not a Number") because `mean()` was called on a vector of
`NA` values while at the same time setting `na.rm = TRUE`. To avoid this, we can
remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to calculate the summary
statistics on weight. Because the missing values are removed first, we can omit
`na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn't run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to
display:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first:


```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function.
If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```


#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each sex, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex)
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is equivalent to:

```{r, purl = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarize(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE)
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations
for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`).
If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`,
we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species)
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of
the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of
the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).

### Reshaping with pivot_wider and pivot_longer

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](https://southampton-rsg.github.io/spreadsheets-data-organisation-and-management/01-format-data/index.html),
we discussed how to structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy
dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `surveys`, the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated
with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex of each animal
associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we
wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus between plots?
(Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised of
values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values
in `genus` would become the names of column variables and the cells
would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore the
relationship between the weight of different genera within, and between, the
plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure,
but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest:
average genus weight per plot instead of recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `pivot_longer()`
and `pivot_wider()`.

#### Pivot_wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data
2. *names_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the name of the output column from
3. *values_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the cell values from

Further arguments include *values_fill* which, if set, fills in missing values with the value provided.


Let's use `pivot_wider()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of each
genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We use `filter()`,
`group_by()` and `summarize()` to filter our observations and variables of
interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_weight`.

```{r, purl=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread across
multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables.
Using `pivot_wider()` with *names_from* `genus` and *values_from* `mean_weight` this becomes
24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wide<- surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight)

str(surveys_wide)
```

![](fig/pivot_wider.png)

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of genera in different plots,
although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight, values_fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### Pivot_longer

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the
form of `surveys_wide`, where the genus names are column names, but we
wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a
pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and
the other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. *cols* indicates the columns to pivot into longer format (or those not to pivot)
3. *names_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names of data.
4. *values_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the data stored in cell values.


To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_wide` we would set *names_to*
`genus` and *values_to* `mean_weight` and use all columns except `plot_id` for
the key variable. Here we exclude `plot_id` from being pivoted.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_long <- surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -plot_id, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight")

str(surveys_long)
```

![](fig/pivot_longer.png)

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the new pivot_longer format. Using pivot_wider and then pivot_longer
can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every
replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be
useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to
specify what to pivot than what to leave alone. And if the columns are directly
adjacent, we don't even need to list them all out - just use the `:` operator!

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Baiomys:Spermophilus, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight") %>%
  head()
```

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good
practice to keep them separate. The `data_raw` folder should only contain the raw,
unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare a
cleaned up version of the data set that doesn't include any missing data.

Let's start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and `hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined:


```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have changed
through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare species (i.e.,
that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do this in two steps: first
we are going to create a data set that counts how often each species has been
observed, and filter out the rare species; then, we will extract only the
observations for these more common species:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>%
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
### Create the dataset for exporting:
##  Start by removing observations for which the `species_id`, `weight`,
##  `hindfoot_length`, or `sex` data are missing:
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
    filter(species_id != "",        # remove missing species_id
           !is.na(weight),                 # remove missing weight
           !is.na(hindfoot_length),        # remove missing hindfoot_length
           sex != "")                      # remove missing sex

##  Now remove rare species in two steps. First, make a list of species which
##  appear at least 50 times in our dataset:
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>%
    filter(n >= 50) %>%
    select(species_id)

##  Second, keep only those species:
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
    filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that `surveys_complete`
has `r nrow(surveys_complete)` rows and `r ncol(surveys_complete)` columns by
typing `dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our `data`
folder.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if (!dir.exists("data")) dir.create("data")
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```
